## Rocket.Chat Auto-Installer
These are a few scripts I created to easily deploy a new installation of Rocket.Chat with zero input for the user, it will automatically fetch required packages and make the necessary software and network configuration a simple out-of-the-box experience.

However it should be required that this is installed on a fresh Virtual Machine or otherwise empty Linux Machine with ether DHCP active or networking otherwise configured for internet access.

## Requirements
rocketinstall(Centos).sh - RHEL based distros

rocketinstall(ubuntu).sh - Ubuntu, Debian, RPM, Pacman based distros
