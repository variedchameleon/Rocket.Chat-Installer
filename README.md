## Rocket.Chat Auto-Installer
This is a script I created to easily deploy a new installation of Rocket.Chat with zero input for the user, it will automatically fetch required packages and make the necessary software and network configuration a simple out-of-the-box experience.

However it should be required that this is installed on a fresh Virtual Machine or otherwise empty instance of a RHEL Linux Machine with ether DHCP active or networking otherwise configured for internet access.
## Downloads
Still working on this, but you can dowload via Git:

```
sudo yum install git
git clone https://github.com/curl/curl.git
```
